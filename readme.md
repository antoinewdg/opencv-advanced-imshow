# Advanced OpenCV imshow

A custom made window I use to provide better functionality over the 
default OpenCV imshow.
Developed using the SFML 2 library.

Currently support:
* zooming with the mouse wheel
* dragging the image
* printing current pixel coordinates
* selecting a rectangle with right-click and printing its coordinates
